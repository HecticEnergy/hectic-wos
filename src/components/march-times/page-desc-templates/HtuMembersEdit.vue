    <b>"order"</b> allows you to specify what order in which your members will
    arrive to the target. Lower numbers will arrive first when you select to
    have the marches separated by a given number of seconds.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b>"group"</b> allows you to specify what group the member is in, making it
    easier to sort members into different groups. Once a group is specified and
    saved, you can quickly assign that group to other members.
  </p>

    This page is mostly designed to correct any issues from the import or adjust
    a member's march time.
