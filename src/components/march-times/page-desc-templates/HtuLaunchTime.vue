    The <b>"March Time"</b> tab is where the magic happens. Once you have
    members imported, you'll spend most of your time here.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Members are saved to your local browser. There is no backend to this
    website, so nothing you enter is saved or stored on a server. If you move to a
    different device or clear your browser's local storage, there is no way to
    recover your data.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>"Offset UTC By"</b> is used to push your march start time back. You
    probably want to offset by at least 1 minute so everyone has a chance to find
    the target and call the rally, but that's entirely up to you.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>"Ignore Seconds"</b> will ignore the seconds in the march time, rounding
    up to the next minute. The offset is displayed on the screen for
    convenience.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>"Separate Each March By"</b> is used to add a delay between each march.
    Instead of attempting to have all marches arrive at the target at the same
    time, you can have them land at different times based on their order.
